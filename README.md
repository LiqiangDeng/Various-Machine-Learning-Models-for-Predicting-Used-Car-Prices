Driving Insights: Various Machine Learning Models for Predicting Used Car Prices

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting used car prices using various machine learning techniques. We aimed to build models to predict the price of used cars based on their information. We obtained more than 90,000 car data from Kaggle and performed data cleaning and different encoding techniques on it. We developed and analyzed the performance of neural networks, gradient boosting, support vector machine, and random forest on this regression problem. By comparing different predictive models, we aim to identify the most effective model for used car price estimation. This project can help consumers make better-informed decisions when purchasing used cars and assist sellers in setting appropriate prices.

## Machine Learning Methods Used

In this project, we have employed the following four machine learning methods for training and prediction:

- Neural Network
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Random Forest

## Running

Each folder corresponds to the corresponding ML model method, and we have copied the dataset into the folder so that each ML method can run independently without being affected.
